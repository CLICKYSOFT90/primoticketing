## Project Setup

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- create .env file on root and add details.
- create file database.php file on config folder
- run composer install --ignore-platform-reqs command on terminal in project folder
- run composer dump-autoload on terminal in project folder
- run php artisan migrate:fresh --seed on terminal in project folder
